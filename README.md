Installation
============
It's quite easy:
* clone me
* open the IntelliJ project
* use menu Build/Prepare Plugin Module ... For Deployment
* open the Settings dialog
* choose Plugins
* use "Install plugin from disk"


Usage
=====
This plugin doesn't create the jQAssistant database. So you should get a copy
from jqassistant.org, configure and run it following the jQAssistant documentation.

When you have created your database, you can open the jQA toolwindow. The database
location has the default value where most probably the database files should reside.
Take the example query or enter your own and hit the 'Find' button gently. The result
is shown in the standard Find toolwindow and you can use it to navigate as you know it.
